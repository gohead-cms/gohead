   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Build and run:
   ```bash
   go build -o app .
   ./app

```

Use `MockJsonPost` for simplified mocking of JSON-based HTTP requests during tests.

### Example Test
```go
func TestPostUser(t *testing.T) {
    exampleUser := map[string]string{
        "username": "test_user",
        "password": "securepassword",
    }
    MockJsonPost(c, exampleUser)
}
```
