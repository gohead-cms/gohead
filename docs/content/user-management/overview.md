# User Management Overview

This document provides an overview of the user and user role models in GoHead, as well as the validation processes and best practices for managing users in the system.

## User Model
The `User` model represents a user in the GoHead system and includes detailed profile information.

### Fields

- **`Username`**: A unique username for the user. This field is required and must be unique.
- **`Email`**: A unique email address for the user. This field is required and must follow a valid email format.
- **`Password`**: The hashed password of the user. It must be at least 6 characters long.
- **`UserRoleID`**: The foreign key referencing the user’s role (not exposed in JSON).
- **`Role`**: The associated user role object.
- **`Slug`**: A unique identifier for the user, typically used in URLs. This field is required.
- **`ProfileImage`**: URL of the user's profile image.
- **`CoverImage`**: Optional URL for the user’s cover image.
- **`Bio`**: A short biography of the user.
- **`Website`**: URL to the user’s personal or professional website.
- **`Location`**: The user’s location.
- **`Facebook`**: Facebook username or handle.

### Validation

#### Password
- Must be at least 6 characters long.

## User Role Model
The `UserRole` model defines the roles and permissions associated with users.

### Fields

- **`ID`**: Unique identifier for the role.
- **`Name`**: Name of the role (e.g., `admin`, `editor`, `viewer`).
- **`Description`**: A description of the role.
- **`Permissions`**: JSON field defining permissions associated with the role.

### Validation

#### Name
- Must be provided.

#### Permissions
- At least one permission must be assigned to the role.

## Validation Functions

### `ValidateUser`
This function validates the `User` model to ensure all required fields meet their constraints:

- Checks for a valid username, email, password, slug, and optional URLs.
- Logs warnings if any field is invalid.
- Returns an error if validation fails.

### `ValidateUserRole`
This function validates the `UserRole` model:

- Ensures the role name is provided.
- Checks that permissions are not empty.
- Logs warnings and returns an error if validation fails.

### `ValidateUserUpdates`
This function validates partial updates to a user’s fields:

- Supports `username`, `email`, `password`, and `role`.
- Checks the validity of updated values.
- Logs warnings and returns an error for unsupported fields or invalid data.

## Best Practices

- **Security**: Use strong passwords and enforce password length requirements.
- **Data Integrity**: Validate all user and role data before saving to the database.
- **Unique Constraints**: Ensure usernames, emails, and slugs are unique.
- **Permissions**: Assign appropriate permissions to roles and validate their structure.
