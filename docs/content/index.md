## What is GoHead?

**GoHead** is a modern, open-source API platform written in Go for managing users, roles, and dynamic JSON-based collections.  
It‚Äôs designed for developers building scalable, cloud-native applications, offering **robust authentication**, **flexible validation**, and **database-agnostic storage**‚Äîall seamlessly deployable on Kubernetes.

* **User & Role Management** ‚Äì Authentication, registration, and RBAC built in.
* **Schema-less Collections** ‚Äì Store structured JSON data without rigid schemas.
* **Field-Level Validation** ‚Äì Ensure uniqueness, type safety, and data integrity.
* **Kubernetes-Ready** ‚Äì First-class support for containerized deployments.

## Use Cases

- **User Management** for SaaS platforms.
- **Dynamic Data Storage** for CMS-like applications.
- **Backend for Web/Mobile Apps** with minimal setup.
- **Custom APIs** without rebuilding authentication and validation from scratch.

    body, _ := json.Marshal(payload)
    req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", "/auth/register", bytes.NewReader(body))
    req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    w := httptest.NewRecorder()
    router.ServeHTTP(w, req)
    assert.Equal(t, http.StatusCreated, w.Code)
