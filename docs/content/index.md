## What is GoHead?

**Gohead** is an event-driven headless CMS built for modern, automated applications. It provides an enterprise-grade platform for defining and managing content via both dynamic GraphQL and REST APIs, featuring robust capabilities like transactional nested content, advanced filtering, and strict schema validation. Its core value lies in its integrated Intelligent Automation Engine, which uses a high-performance job system to trigger AI and custom workflows in real-time response to any data change, effectively turning your CMS into a flexible automation hub for content and business logic.

* **Intelligent Event Automation**: Real-time, event-driven workflows that trigger custom logic or AI actions instantly when content is created or updated.
* **Atomic Nested Transactions**: Guarantee data integrity by supporting the creation and linkage of complex, multi-level relational content within a single, atomic operation.
* **Dynamic GraphQL API**: Instantly generates and hot-reloads GraphQL schema based on your content definitions, eliminating API development time.
* **AI Tooling & Automation**: Integrate specialized AI capabilities (like sentiment analysis or summarization) into your workflows via dedicated, interchangeable provider tools.
* **Microservice-Ready Job System**: Dedicated background processing for asynchronous tasks, webhooks, and schedules, ensuring your main application remains fast and responsive.
* **Component-Based Content Modeling**: Define reusable blocks of fields to standardize and accelerate the creation of complex content types across your collections.
* **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and token-based authentication secure all data and API endpoints.

## Use Cases

* **Real-Time Content Automation**: Automatically trigger AI-powered actions—like generating SEO metadata or summarizing content—the moment an item is saved or updated.
* **Approval and Notification Workflows**: Build multi-step review and notification systems, where content events trigger external communication (email, Slack) or status changes.
* **Atomic Catalog Management**: Manage complex e-commerce or product catalogs by ensuring multiple related items (e.g., product, stock, and features) are created or updated in a single, reliable transaction.
* **Background Data Processing**: Offload heavy, recurring tasks—such as synchronizing inventory or large data imports—to high-performance background job queues, ensuring core API speed.
* **Flexible Configuration Management**: Use dedicated content types for secure, easily updated, and universally accessible application settings (feature flags, API keys).
* **Event-Sourced Auditing**: Capture a full, immutable log of all content changes by routing content events to an external analytics or compliance system.
