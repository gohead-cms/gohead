## What is GoHead?

**GoHead** is a modern API platform for managing users, roles, and dynamic JSON-based collections. It’s designed for developers building scalable, microservices-ready applications with robust authentication, validation, and storage solutions.

* Manage user authentication, registration, and role-based access seamlessly.
* Store dynamic JSON collections without the need for predefined schemas.
* Ensure field-level validation, including uniqueness checks, for data integrity.
* Built with Go and fully integrated with Kubernetes.

## Use Cases

- **User Management**: Manage user registration, login, and roles.
- **Dynamic Data Storage**: Easily store, update, and query JSON data collections.

```

### Example
```go
func TestRegister(t *testing.T) {

    payload := map[string]string{
        "username": "testuser",
        "password": "securepassword",
        "email": "testuser@example.com",
        "role_name": "viewer",
    }

    body, _ := json.Marshal(payload)
    req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", "/auth/register", bytes.NewReader(body))
    req.Header.Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

    w := httptest.NewRecorder()
    router.ServeHTTP(w, req)

    assert.Equal(t, http.StatusCreated, w.Code)
}
```
