# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of the **GOHEAD** project pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the **GOHEAD** project or its community.

Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [contact@gohead.io](mailto:contact@gohead.io).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

When inappropriate behavior is reported, maintainers will discuss the report on the Maintainer's Discord before marking the message as "abuse." This ensures decisions are made collaboratively and fairly.

### Enforcement Steps

1. The first message will be edited and marked as abuse.  
   **Edited content:**  
   `Dear user, we want GOHEAD to provide a welcoming and respectful environment. Your [comment/issue/PR] has been reported and marked as abuse according to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Thank you.`
2. The second edited and marked abuse message results in a 7-day ban.
3. The third edited and marked abuse message results in a permanent ban.

The [report must be resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-reported-content-in-your-organizations-repository#resolving-a-report) accordingly.
