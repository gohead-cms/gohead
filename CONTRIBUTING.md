## Code Style

- Follow the **Golang standard style guidelines**.
- Use `gofmt` or `gocritic` to format your code before submitting.
- Maintain consistency with the existing codebase.

## Commit Messages

Use this format for commit messages:  
`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

- `fix(ui): resolve alignment issue in header`
- `docs(readme): update contributing section`

### Allowed Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Merge Request Guidelines

1. Ensure your code is **up to date** with the main branch:
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   Make sure your code passes all tests before submitting:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

3. **Submit a Merge Request**:
   - Push your branch to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```
   - Open a merge request (MR) on the original repository: [Gohead GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/sudo.bngz/gohead).

4. **Describe Your Changes**:
   In the merge request description, explain:
   - What problem your changes solve
   - How they solve it
   - Any additional context or considerations
